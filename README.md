# NATO-Phonetic-Alphabet-Speller-with-Python
Overview:
The NATO Phonetic Alphabet Speller is a Python-based program designed to make spelling words easier and more accurate in situations where clarity is critical. By utilizing the NATO phonetic alphabet, this project translates letters into universally recognized code words like “Alpha,” “Bravo,” and “Charlie,” ensuring effective communication over phone calls or in noisy environments.

Features

- Real-time Conversion: Convert any word into its NATO phonetic alphabet equivalent instantly.

- Error Handling: Detects invalid characters (like numbers or symbols) and prompts users to input a valid word.

- Interactive and User-Friendly: A console-based interface ensures simplicity and reusability.

- Educational Tool: Helps users familiarize themselves with the NATO phonetic alphabet while using the tool.

How It Works: The program reads the NATO phonetic alphabet from a CSV file, mapping each letter of the alphabet to its corresponding phonetic word.
When a user inputs a word, the program checks and processes each letter to generate the corresponding phonetic code.
If invalid characters are input, the program displays an error message and prompts the user to try again.


Example Usage:
Enter your word: Tisha  
Output: ["Tango", "India", "Sierra", "Hotel", "Alpha"]
